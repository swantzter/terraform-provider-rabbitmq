## Using the Provider

To use a released version of the Terraform provider in your environment, run `terraform init` and Terraform will automatically install the provider from the Terraform Registry. For either installation method, documentation about the provider configuration, resources, and data sources can be found on the Terraform Registry.

terraform init -upgrade
```
